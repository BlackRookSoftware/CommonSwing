==== Introduction

This library attempts to re-abstract Java's Swing extensions into a
inheritance-based framework rather than an event-driven one. While this
project does not seek to undermine the functionality of Swing, this should
at the very least help in making the creation of Swing-based forms and 
inputs less daunting to those who are used to an inheritance model.

==== Library

Contained in this release is a series of classes that should be used for
alleviating the difficulties of dealing with the more tedious parts of Swing.
The javadocs contain basic outlines of each package's contents.

NOTE: There was never a version 1.0 of this project - this used to be a part of
Commons 1.0, and is called 2.0 just for the sake of consistency.
